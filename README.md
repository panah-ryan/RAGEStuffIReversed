# RAGEStuffIReversed
Lots of notes and other junk I reversed from RAGE (Mostly GTA IV &amp; RDR Xbox).
There are no crashes in this or protections (other than RDR), this was mostly stuff I had stored in my notes of reversing and my idb from all my years of working on RAGE. There is plenty other stuff I missed and I can upload my work on other RAGE games if requested.

Would appreciate creds but I know that barely happens
99% of this is reversed by hand, I don't use IDA's or Ghidra's Pseudocode Generators (80% of time is wrong anyways for PPC)
